# For the developers:

This app was made from the node.js library used to port HTML files to windows apps.

So, the app uses the TVCLIENT 1.5 library to run YouTube TV.

You can modify it, but you will need node.js libraries and the source code is currently not fully editable.

You can get started by editing the main.js and nativefier.js. These define the url and working of the app.
You only need to edit the nativefier.js and commit the file changes and after verifying your changes, the application will be packaged into a .zip file or an
.exe installer.
